homebridge-pc-volume is a Homebridge plugin that adds a support for changing a computer's volume using HomeKit and Siri.

## OS Support

homebridge-pc-volume utilises [node-loudness](https://github.com/LinusU/node-loudness), which currently supports macOS and Linux (using ALSA).

HomeKit is supported by iOS. Note that HomeKit does not support the "speaker" accessory type, so this will be shown as a lightbulb. If anyone knows how to get iOS to support a speaker, please create an issue or a PR.

## Installation

First, [install Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge#installation).

Then install homebridge-pc-volume via `npm`:

`npm install -g homebridge-pc-volume`

homebridge-pc-volume will also need to be specified as an accessory in your `~/.homebridge/config.json`:

```
  "accessories": [
    {
      "accessory": "ComputerSpeakers",
      "name": "MacBook"
    }
  ]
```

Note that `accessory` _must_ be "ComputerSpeakers", while the `name` can be any value of your choosing.

## Configuration

The `services` property can be used to decide how your computer's speaker will be exposed: as a lightbulb, fan, speaker, or a combination of all 3.

Please note that while iOS 11 supports "HomeKit speakers" this appears to actually be via AirPlay 2, so the "speaker" option is unlikely to work!

If no services key is provided a lightbulb will be exposed.

### Lightbulb Only (default, implicit)

```
  "accessories": [
    {
      "accessory": "ComputerSpeakers",
      "name": "MacBook"
    }
  ]
```

### Lightbulb Only (default prior to 1.1)

```
  "accessories": [
    {
      "accessory": "ComputerSpeakers",
      "name": "MacBook",
      "services": ["lightbulb"]
    }
  ]
```

### Fan Only

```
  "accessories": [
    {
      "accessory": "ComputerSpeakers",
      "name": "MacBook",
      "services": ["fan"]
    }
  ]
```

### Speaker and Fan

```
  "accessories": [
    {
      "accessory": "ComputerSpeakers",
      "name": "MacBook",
      "services": ["speaker", "fan"]
    }
  ]
```

## Development

To develop homebridge-pc-volume locally:

1. Clone the project
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `npm install -g ./`

This will allow homebridge to find your local version of homebridge-pc-volume.

After making changes you will need to restart homebridge. You may also stop any homebridge instance you already have running and run `yarn run watch`, which will start homebridge, and automatically restart it when a source file is updated.
